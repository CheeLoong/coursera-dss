# R programming Week 2
This week is all about functions and about controlling the flow of an R program. We start with control structures (like if-else, and for loops) and then move on to writing functions. 
Next, we discuss the lexical scoping features of the language and how they can be used in interesting ways, particularly for statistical applications.

# R-script Information
- Write an if-else expression
- Write a for loop, a while loop, and a repeat loop
- Define a function in R and specify its return value [see Functions Part 1 and Part 2]
- Describe how R binds a value to a symbol via the search list
- Define what lexical scoping is with respect to how the value of free variables are resolved in R
- Describe the difference between lexical scoping and dynamic scoping rules
- Convert a character string representing a date/time into an R datetime object. [see Dates and Times]
