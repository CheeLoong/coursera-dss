# Exploratory Data Analysis Week 3

This week covers some of the workhouse statistical methods for exploratory analysis. 
- These methods include clustering and dimension reduction techniques that allow you to make graphical displays of very high dimensional data (many many variables).
- Novel way ways to specify colours in R so that you can use colours as an important and useful dimension when making data graphics. (Refer Exploratory Data Analysis with R chapters 9 - 12)
