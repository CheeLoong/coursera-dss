# Principles of Analytic Graphics

# Principle 1: Show camparisons

- Evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing hypothesis.
- Always ask "Compared to What?"
(e.g. A plot that shows Air cleaner introduction to house vs no air cleaner on ashtma symptom free days)

# Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure

- What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?
(e.g. Why does installing an air cleaner increases one symptom-free day, we hypothesize that air cleaner is cleaning the air, removing particulate matter thats no longer entering the child's lung)
- Following what our logical explanation on the matter, we then show a plot that would corroborate that evidence.
(e.g. Comparing symptom free days (box plot 1) vs Fine Particulate Matter (boxplot 2), looking at box plot 2, for group of homes that got the air cleaner, the particulate matter is significantly lower)
- Therefore, looking at both of the boxplots, we can say not only did the symptom-free days increased when we have air cleaner, the particulate matter levels decreased, on average.
- To really confirm this hypothesis, we need to do a lot of investigation and experimentation but this graphic kind of suggests a possible explanation

# Principle 3: Show multivariate data

- Multivariate = more than 2 variables
(e.g. an air pollution plot that shows that daily mortality has a negative association with ParticulateMatter10 concentration which is counterintuitive, this reasoning is that there is a confounding variable which is season, after splitting into 4 different seasons we see that in each plot there's a positive association between PM10 and Mortality)
- The real world is multivariate
- Need to "escape flatland"

# Principle 4: Integation of evidence

- Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
- Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
- Don't let the tool drive the analysis

# Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.

- A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible

# Principle 6: Content is King

- Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their content
