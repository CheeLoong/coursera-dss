# R programming Week 4
This week covers how to simulate data in R, which serves as the basis for doing simulation studies. We also cover the profiler in R which lets you collect detailed information on how your R functions are running and to identify bottlenecks that can be addressed. The profiler is a key tool in helping you optimize your programs. Finally, we cover the str function

# R-script Information
- Call the str function on an arbitrary R object
- Describe the difference between the "by.self" and "by.total" output produced by the R profiler
- Simulate a random normal variable with an arbitrary mean and standard deviation
- Simulate data from a normal linear model
