# Getting & Cleaning Data Week 1
One of the major components of a data scientist's job is to collect and clean data. Whether at a small organization or a major enterprise, the first step in using data is getting, cleaning and understanding the data.

We will also cover a variety of formats including JSON, XML, and flat files (.csv, .txt).
